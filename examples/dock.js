/*Demonstrates how you can take control of Roomba, even in passive mode, and how to combine
user-control (in FULL mode) with built-in functions like autoDock (in PASSIVE mode).

The robot starts in full mode [LINE 68] and drives forward unless bumper, wheel drop,
or proximity sensors are triggered [LINE 112]. If the robot detects the home base
[LINE 90], it exits user-control, entering PASSIVE mode, and starts automatic docking.
(Screen should flash 'SEEK')

There are several problems with relying on PASSIVE mode, however:

1. We have no way of knowing if the docking procedure has stopped or encountered an error.
We solve this by restarting docking mode if the state of the wheel drop sensors changes
[LINE 102]. The bumper switches are ignored, as they don't interrupt the docking procedure.
(Screen should flash 'RST' when docking is restarted)

2. In PASSIVE mode, pressing the clean button starts the cleaning procedure (imagine that)
The solution to this can be found in the preventDefault function [LINE 155]. If clean is pressed
while docked, we allow clean to be enabled [LINE 95]. Otherwise, we call preventDefault to prevent
a clean cycle from starting.

When the robot detects power on docking contacts [LINE 98], we know we've docked successfully.
We change to FULL mode for a second to display a message on the screen, then back to PASSIVE,
since the robot won't charge in FULL mode. (Screen should quickly flash 'DOCK')

As previously mentioned, we usually cancel presses to the clean button in PASSIVE mode,
but when docked, we allow the robot to start a clean cycle. This is because when docked,
the robot backs out and turns around (while making a cute beeping noise) before cleaning.
From testing, this takes about 4.4 seconds, so as soon as the robot looses contact with
the dock [LINE 100], we call setUndock, which sets a timer for 4.4 seconds [LINE 120].
When the timer ends, it re-enables user-control, stopping the cleaning cycle
before the actual cleaning starts. Of course, we also play song 0 again [LINE 122].
(Screen should scroll 'UNDOCK')

The robot will also turn around 180 degrees whenever you enter 't' into the terminal
[LINE 133], changing direction each time. If the function is called while a turn is
already in progress [LINE 129], the robot will return to it's original angle. The
angle is tracked with a variable that stores changes in angle delta [LINE 148].

The only other thing that might be worth mentioning is the seemingly odd 2nd onChange
callback at line 76. This function only runs once, the first time the onChange event
is fired, and simply checks if the robot is already docked when the program starts.
(Otherwise we'd start driving into the dock!)*/

//TL;DR...
//Robot moves, stops for obstacles, and auto-docks when it sees the base station.
//Enter 't' into terminal to make robot turn 180 degrees.
//Enter 's' into terminal to stop turning prematurely.
